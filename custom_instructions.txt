IMPORTANT CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI CHAT SESSION:
When providing code changes, indicate the relative path of the file or files that need changes.

For each file that needs changing:
- If you are only changing one line, provide just the updated line with context
- If you are changing more than one line, provide either entire updated functions or the entire updated code file

General notes:
- Provide minimal code changes.  Avoid making unnecessary changes that will contribute to diff noise.
- Only add comments that are necessary for understanding the logical flow of the code and adhere to documentation best practices.
- Do not add comments that point out to the user where the updated / changed parts of the code are, such as: // Updated line of code goes here

END CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS
